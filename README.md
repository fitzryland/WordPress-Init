WordPress Init
==============

Bash script to launch a full WordPress boilerplate install and theme ready for dev.
The other stuff in the repo is stuff I like to add to _s

I am sure a whole lot of this could be done much more efficiently, but I am learning as I am going. And, most importantly, it works (for me in my bubble)!


TODO
----

- add local remote differentiation stuff
- launch MAMP
- Start using Vagrant (like a real developer...)
- add image optimization to theme files
- enque main.js

Local Dependencies
------------------

- GIT
- WP-CLI
- MAMP (servers running, MAMP and WP-CLI are a pain to get to play nice)
- Grunt
- Sass
- Bourbon & Neat (Flexible grid framework)
